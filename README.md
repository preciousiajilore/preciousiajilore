👋🏾 Hi there! My name is Precious Ajilore.

🌟 Check out my website: https://preciousajilore.netlify.app/ 

🎓 I’m studying for a Bachelor of Science in Computing Science at the University of Alberta, set to graduate in September 2026.

🇳🇬 x 🇬🇭 I was born in Ghana but I’m proudly Nigerian. I am strongly interested in AI/Machine Learning, Web development, and Software development. 

📚 I’ve been coding since high school, using languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and C. I also use creative tools like Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, and Figma for various projects and designs.
Right now, I’m a fellow at the AI4Good Lab. Here, I’m improving my skills in defining problems, preparing data, and choosing models. This experience is enhancing my technical skills and allowing me to make a meaningful contribution to the AI field.

💻 In the future, I hope to work in software development or AI/machine learning. I’m also very motivated to develop tools and technologies that use AI for positive social impact.

📹 When I have some free time, I enjoy editing photos, making vlogs, baking, and drawing.

💪🏽 Some of my strengths include but are not limited to : 
- Leadership and Team Management: I’ve led teams in various student clubs and the University of Alberta Ambassador program, showing my ability to organize and inspire team members to achieve shared goals.
Social Media Management: Managed social media pages for various groups and small businesses, using strategies to boost user engagement and interaction.
- Community Engagement: Took part in university events like the Week of Welcome, helping build community connections and adding to a lively campus environment.
